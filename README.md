### Testing

The unit tests are run as follows

### Scripts

#### Message

The *lib/wamp_client/message.rb* file and the *spec/message_spec.rb* file are autogenerated using the script
*scripts/gen_message.rb*.  This is done as follows

    $ cd scripts
    $ ./gen_message.rb
    $ mv message.rb.tmp ../lib/wamp_client/message.rb
    $ mv message_spec.rb.tmp ../spec/message_spec.rb

As I was writing the code for the messages I caught myself cutting and pasting allot and decided these would be
better suited to be autogenerated.
